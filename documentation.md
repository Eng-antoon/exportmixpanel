API_EMAIL = "antoon.kamel@illa.com.eg"
API_PASSWORD = "1234567"

# The token below is an example API token
API_TOKEN = os.getenv("API_TOKEN", "eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJpZCI6MTg4LCJlbWFpbCI...")

BASE_API_URL = "https://app.illa.blue/api/v2"
```

**Configuration Details:**
- Uses environment variables for sensitive configuration when available
- Provides sensible defaults for development environments
- Integrates with external APIs using authentication tokens
- Supports token refresh mechanisms when tokens expire

## 3. Trip Quality Analysis

The heart of this application is the sophisticated algorithm for calculating expected trip quality based on GPS tracking data analysis.

### 3.1 Trip Quality Metrics

The system analyzes several key metrics to determine trip quality:

1. **Logs Count**: Number of GPS coordinates recorded during a trip
   - Higher log counts generally indicate better tracking
   - Normalized to a maximum of 500 logs in the calculation

2. **GPS Accuracy Flag**: Boolean indicator for GPS accuracy issues
   - When true, applies a 20% penalty to the quality score

3. **Segment Analysis**:
   - **Short Segments**: Distance < 1km
   - **Medium Segments**: Distance between 1-5km
   - **Long Segments**: Distance > 5km
   - Analysis includes both count and total distance for each segment type

### 3.2 Quality Calculation Algorithm

The algorithm follows a multi-step process:

```python
def calculate_expected_trip_quality(
    logs_count, 
    lack_of_accuracy, 
    medium_segments_count, 
    long_segments_count, 
    short_dist_total, 
    medium_dist_total, 
    long_dist_total,
    calculated_distance
):
    # Special cases
    if (short_dist_total + medium_dist_total + long_dist_total) <= 0 or logs_count <= 1:
        return "No Logs Trip"
        
    if logs_count < 5 and medium_segments_count == 0 and long_segments_count == 0:
        return "No Logs Trip"
        
    if logs_count < 50 and (medium_segments_count > 0 or long_segments_count > 0):
        return "Trip Points Only Exist"
    
    # Calculate logs factor (normalized to 500 logs)
    logs_factor = min(logs_count / 500.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate segment ratio
    ratio = short_dist_total / (medium_dist_total + long_dist_total + 0.01)  # epsilon to avoid division by zero
    
    # Segment factor based on ratio
    if ratio >= 5:
        segment_factor = 1.0
    elif ratio <= 0.5:
        segment_factor = 0.0
    else:
        segment_factor = (ratio - 0.5) / 4.5
    
    # Overall quality score
    quality_score = 0.5 * logs_factor + 0.5 * segment_factor
    
    # Apply penalty for GPS accuracy issues
    if lack_of_accuracy:
        quality_score *= 0.8

    # Map to quality categories
    if quality_score >= 0.8 and (medium_dist_total + long_dist_total) <= 0.05*calculated_distance:
        return "High Quality Trip"
    elif quality_score >= 0.8:
        return "Moderate Quality Trip"
    else:
        return "Low Quality Trip"
```

**Algorithm Decision Points:**

1. **Special Case Handling**:
   - Returns "No Logs Trip" if total distance is ≤ 0 or logs_count ≤ 1
   - Returns "No Logs Trip" if logs_count < 5 with no medium/long segments
   - Returns "Trip Points Only Exist" if logs_count < 50 but with medium/long segments

2. **Logs Factor Calculation**:
   - Normalizes log count to a maximum of 500 logs
   - Formula: `logs_factor = min(logs_count / 500.0, 1.0)`

3. **Segment Ratio Analysis**:
   - Calculates ratio of short distance to medium+long distances
   - Formula: `ratio = short_dist_total / (medium_dist_total + long_dist_total + epsilon)`
   - Uses epsilon (0.01) to avoid division by zero

4. **Segment Factor Determination**:
   - If ratio ≥ 5: segment_factor = 1.0 (high proportion of short segments)
   - If ratio ≤ 0.5: segment_factor = 0.0 (low proportion of short segments)
   - Otherwise: segment_factor = (ratio - 0.5) / 4.5 (linear scaling)

5. **Quality Score Calculation**:
   - Formula: `quality_score = 0.5 * logs_factor + 0.5 * segment_factor`
   - Equal weighting (50%) to logs factor and segment factor

6. **Accuracy Penalty**:
   - If lack_of_accuracy flag is True, apply 20% penalty
   - Formula: `quality_score *= 0.8`

7. **Quality Category Assignment**:
   - "High Quality Trip" if score ≥ 0.8 AND (medium_dist_total + long_dist_total) ≤ 5% of calculated_distance
   - "Moderate Quality Trip" if score ≥ 0.8 but not meeting above condition
   - "Low Quality Trip" if score < 0.5

### 3.3 Quality Categories

The algorithm classifies trips into the following quality categories:

1. **High Quality Trip**: Score ≥ 0.8 with minimal medium/long segments
   - Indicates excellent GPS tracking with sufficient logs and appropriate segment distribution
   - Requires medium+long segments to make up ≤5% of total calculated distance

2. **Moderate Quality Trip**: 0.5 ≤ Score < 0.8 or Score ≥ 0.8 with significant medium/long segments
   - Acceptable GPS tracking with some potential issues
   - Includes high-scoring trips with >5% medium+long segments

3. **Low Quality Trip**: Score < 0.5
   - Poor GPS tracking with significant issues
   - Indicates unreliable tracking data

4. **Trip Points Only Exist**: Few logs (<50) but with medium/long segments
   - Indicates sporadic tracking with large gaps between points
   - Suggests the app recorded only occasional positions instead of continuous tracking

5. **No Logs Trip**: Minimal or non-existent GPS data
   - Triggered when logs_count ≤ 1 OR total recorded distance ≤ 0
   - Also applies to trips with <5 logs and no medium/long segments
   - Represents complete tracking failure

## 4. Distance Calculations

### 4.1 Haversine Distance Formula

Trip distances are calculated using the Haversine formula, which determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere based on their latitude and longitude coordinates:

```python
def haversine_distance(coord1, coord2):
    """
    Calculate the great circle distance between two points 
    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees)
    """
    lat1, lon1 = coord1
    lat2, lon2 = coord2
    
    # Convert decimal degrees to radians
    lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 = map(math.radians, [lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2])
    
    # Haversine formula
    dlon = lon2 - lon1
    dlat = lat2 - lat1
    a = math.sin(dlat/2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon/2)**2
    c = 2 * math.asin(math.sqrt(a))
    r = 6371  # Radius of earth in kilometers
    return c * r
```

**Mathematical Details:**
1. Convert latitude and longitude from decimal degrees to radians
2. Calculate the haversine of the central angle between points:
   - a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) × cos(lat2) × sin²(Δlon/2)
3. Calculate the central angle (c) using inverse haversine:
   - c = 2 × atan2(√a, √(1-a)) or c = 2 × asin(√a)
4. Calculate the distance:
   - d = R × c (where R is Earth's radius, 6371 km)

### 4.2 Segment Analysis

The `analyze_trip_segments` function calculates various metrics by processing consecutive GPS coordinates:

```python
def analyze_trip_segments(coordinates):
    """
    Analyze coordinates to calculate distance metrics:
    - Count and total distance of short segments (<1km)
    - Count and total distance of medium segments (1-5km)
    - Count and total distance of long segments (>5km)
    - Maximum segment distance
    - Average segment distance
    """
    # Implementation details...
    
    # Note: API returns coordinates as [lon, lat], so we need to swap
    # Let's convert to [lat, lon] for calculations
    coords = [[float(point[1]), float(point[0])] for point in coordinates]
    
    # Initialize counters
    short_segments_count = 0
    medium_segments_count = 0
    long_segments_count = 0
    short_segments_distance = 0
    medium_segments_distance = 0
    long_segments_distance = 0
    max_segment_distance = 0
    total_distance = 0
    segment_count = 0
    
    # Process each segment (pair of consecutive points)
    for i in range(len(coords) - 1):
        distance = haversine_distance(coords[i], coords[i+1])
        segment_count += 1
        total_distance += distance
        
        # Categorize by distance
        if distance < 1:
            short_segments_count += 1
            short_segments_distance += distance
        elif distance <= 5:
            medium_segments_count += 1
            medium_segments_distance += distance
        else:
            long_segments_count += 1
            long_segments_distance += distance
            
        if distance > max_segment_distance:
            max_segment_distance = distance
            
    avg_segment_distance = total_distance / segment_count if segment_count > 0 else 0
    
    # Return comprehensive metrics dictionary
    return {
        "short_segments_count": short_segments_count,
        "medium_segments_count": medium_segments_count,
        "long_segments_count": long_segments_count,
        "short_segments_distance": round(short_segments_distance, 2),
        "medium_segments_distance": round(medium_segments_distance, 2),
        "long_segments_distance": round(long_segments_distance, 2),
        "max_segment_distance": round(max_segment_distance, 2),
        "avg_segment_distance": round(avg_segment_distance, 2)
    }
```

Key metrics calculated include:
- Short segments (< 1km): count and total distance
- Medium segments (1-5km): count and total distance
- Long segments (> 5km): count and total distance
- Maximum segment distance: largest distance between any two consecutive points
- Average segment distance: mean distance between consecutive points

**Important Implementation Notes:**
- The function handles coordinate format conversion (API returns [longitude, latitude])
- Returns default values for invalid input (empty or single-point coordinates)
- Rounds calculated distances to 2 decimal places for readability
- Handles potential division by zero in average calculation

## 5. Additional Metrics and Insights

The application calculates several additional metrics to provide comprehensive insights:

### 5.1 Distance Variance

**Average Distance Variance (%)**
- Measures the average percentage difference between calculated distance (from GPS data) and manually recorded distance
- Formula: `variance = abs(calculated_distance - manual_distance) / manual_distance * 100`
- Provides insight into the accuracy of GPS tracking compared to user-reported distances

**Calculation Implementation:**
```python
variance_sum = 0.0
variance_count = 0

for trip in filtered_trips:
    try:
        md = float(trip.manual_distance)
        cd = float(trip.calculated_distance)
        
        if md > 0:
            variance = abs(cd - md) / md * 100
            variance_sum += variance
            variance_count += 1
    except:
        pass

avg_distance_variance = variance_sum / variance_count if variance_count else 0
```

### 5.2 Accurate Trips

**Accurate Trips (<25% variance)**
- Counts trips where the variance between calculated and manual distance is less than 25%
- Identifies the proportion of trips with reliable GPS tracking data

**Calculation Implementation:**
```python
accurate_count = 0

for trip in filtered_trips:
    try:
        md = float(trip.manual_distance)
        cd = float(trip.calculated_distance)
        
        if md > 0:
            variance = abs(cd - md) / md * 100
            if variance < 25.0:
                accurate_count += 1
    except:
        pass

accurate_count_pct = (accurate_count / total_trips * 100) if total_trips else 0
```

### 5.3 App Killed Issue Trips

**App Killed Issue Detection**
- Identifies trips where the tracking app was likely terminated by the operating system
- Detection criteria:
  - No lack of accuracy flag
  - Non-zero calculated distance
  - Medium and long segments make up at least 40% of the total calculated distance
  - At least one medium or long segment exists
- Important for identifying device-specific issues that interrupt tracking

**Calculation Implementation:**
```python
app_killed_count = 0

for trip in filtered_trips:
    try:
        if trip.lack_of_accuracy is False and float(trip.calculated_distance) > 0:
            lm_distance = (float(trip.medium_segments_distance or 0) 
                          + float(trip.long_segments_distance or 0))
            lm_count = (trip.medium_segments_count or 0) + (trip.long_segments_count or 0)
            if lm_count > 0 and (lm_distance / float(trip.calculated_distance)) >= 0.4:
                app_killed_count += 1
    except:
        pass

app_killed_pct = (app_killed_count / total_trips * 100) if total_trips else 0
```

### 5.4 Single Log Trips

**Trips with Only 1 Log**
- Counts trips with exactly one coordinate logged
- Indicates a critical failure in continuous tracking
- These trips represent cases where the app started tracking but immediately failed

**Calculation Implementation:**
```python
one_log_count = 0

for trip in filtered_trips:
    if trip.coordinate_count == 1:
        one_log_count += 1

one_log_pct = (one_log_count / total_trips * 100) if total_trips else 0
```

### 5.5 Segment Distance Percentages

**Distance Distribution Analysis**
- Calculates what percentage of the total calculated distance comes from each segment type:
  - Short segments (< 1km)
  - Medium segments (1-5km)
  - Long segments (> 5km)
- Helps identify patterns in tracking data gaps

**Calculation Implementation:**
```python
total_short_dist = 0.0
total_medium_dist = 0.0
total_long_dist = 0.0
total_calculated = 0.0

for trip in filtered_trips:
    try:
        cd = float(trip.calculated_distance)
        total_calculated += cd
        
        if trip.short_segments_distance:
            total_short_dist += float(trip.short_segments_distance)
        if trip.medium_segments_distance:
            total_medium_dist += float(trip.medium_segments_distance)
        if trip.long_segments_distance:
            total_long_dist += float(trip.long_segments_distance)
    except:
        pass

short_dist_pct = (total_short_dist / total_calculated * 100) if total_calculated else 0
medium_dist_pct = (total_medium_dist / total_calculated * 100) if total_calculated else 0
long_dist_pct = (total_long_dist / total_calculated * 100) if total_calculated else 0
```

### 5.6 Carrier Normalization

The application normalizes carrier names to handle variations in how carriers are reported:

```python
# Carrier grouping
CARRIER_GROUPS = {
    "Vodafone": ["vodafone", "voda fone", "tegi ne3eesh"],
    "Orange": ["orange", "orangeeg", "orange eg"],
    "Etisalat": ["etisalat", "e& etisalat", "e&"],
    "We": ["we"]
}

def normalize_carrier(carrier_name):
    if not carrier_name:
        return ""
    lower = carrier_name.lower().strip()
    for group, variants in CARRIER_GROUPS.items():
        for variant in variants:
            if variant in lower:
                return group
    return carrier_name
```

This normalization ensures consistent analysis across different carrier name variants, improving the accuracy of carrier-related insights.

## 7. Technical Implementation

### 7.1 API Integration

The application integrates with:
- Mixpanel API for data export
- External APIs for additional trip data retrieval

**Authentication Methods:**
```python
def fetch_api_token():
    url = f"{BASE_API_URL}/auth/sign_in"
    payload = {"admin_user": {"email": API_EMAIL, "password": API_PASSWORD}}
    resp = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    if resp.status_code == 200:
        return resp.json().get("token", None)
    else:
        print("Error fetching primary token:", resp.text)
        return None

def fetch_api_token_alternative():
    alt_email = "SupplyPartner@illa.com.eg"
    alt_password = "654321"
    url = f"{BASE_API_URL}/auth/sign_in"
    payload = {"admin_user": {"email": alt_email, "password": alt_password}}
    try:
        resp = requests.post(url, json=payload)
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return resp.json().get("token", None)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error fetching alternative token:", e)
        return None
```

- Implements primary and fallback authentication methods
- Handles authentication errors gracefully
- Manages token refresh when tokens expire

### 7.2 Asynchronous Processing

Long-running tasks are handled asynchronously:
- Data export and consolidation
- Bulk trip updates
- Impact analysis comparisons
- Progress tracking for user feedback

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Global dict to track progress of long-running operations
progress_data = {}
executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=40)

# Example of progress tracking
def update_progress(job_id, percent, status=None, message=None):
    progress_data[job_id] = {
        'percent': percent,
        'status': status,
        'message': message,
        'updated_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }

# Example of asynchronous task execution
def process_trips_async(job_id, trip_ids):
    update_progress(job_id, 0, 'starting', 'Beginning processing...')
    total = len(trip_ids)
    
    for i, trip_id in enumerate(trip_ids):
        try:
            # Process trip logic here
            percent_complete = ((i + 1) / total) * 100
            update_progress(job_id, percent_complete, 'processing', f'Processed {i+1} of {total} trips')
        except Exception as e:
            update_progress(job_id, percent_complete, 'error', f'Error processing trip {trip_id}: {str(e)}')
    
    update_progress(job_id, 100, 'completed', 'All trips processed successfully')
```

- Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent processing
- Implements a progress tracking system with real-time updates
- Handles exceptions and errors gracefully during async operations
- Provides detailed status information to the user interface

### 7.3 Data Visualization

The application utilizes:
- Chart.js for interactive charts
- DataTables for sortable and filterable data tables
- Custom UI components for specialized insights

**Visualization Implementation:**
- Dynamic chart generation based on filtered data
- Interactive visualizations with drill-down capabilities
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile viewing
- Custom color schemes for different data categories
- Animation effects for enhanced user experience

### 7.4 Session Management and Filtering

The application implements sophisticated session management for filters:

```python
def get_saved_filters():
    return flask_session.get("saved_filters", {})

def save_filter_to_session(name, filters):
    saved = flask_session.get("saved_filters", {})
    saved[name] = filters
    flask_session["saved_filters"] = saved
```

This allows users to save complex filter combinations and reuse them across sessions.
