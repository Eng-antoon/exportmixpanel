## Critical Factors Affecting Tracking

| Factor | Impact | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Background Task Killing** | High | Determines if tracking app stays active |
| **RAM Capacity** | Medium-High | Affects app's ability to run continuously |
| **Android Version** | Medium | Newer versions have better location APIs |
| **Sensor Availability** | Medium | Gyroscope, compass improve location accuracy |
| **Device Age** | Medium | Newer hardware typically performs better |
