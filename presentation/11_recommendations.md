## Device Optimization Strategies

* **Targeted Device Recommendations**:
  - Suggest optimal devices for reliable tracking
  - Minimum specifications: Android 10+, 4GB+ RAM, Gyroscope sensor
  - Preferred manufacturers: Samsung, Google (moderate background killing)

* **App Optimization**:
  - Implement different tracking strategies based on device
  - Use foreground services on aggressive battery-saving devices
  - Implement fallback mechanisms for devices with high killing tendency
  - Reduce tracking frequency on low-RAM devices

## Future Development Priorities

1. **Device-Specific Tracking**: Customize tracking algorithm by device model
2. **Background Task Protection**: Implement additional safeguards on Chinese OEMs
3. **Battery Optimization**: Reduce tracking frequency when battery is low
4. **Machine Learning Implementation**: Predictive models for tracking failures
5. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Proactive detection of tracking issues
6. **Offline Tracking**: Improved capability when network connectivity is poor
