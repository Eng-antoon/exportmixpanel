## Quality Metrics Analysis

| Metric | Description | Importance |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Logs Count** | Number of GPS coordinates recorded | Higher count = More continuous tracking |
| **GPS Accuracy** | Boolean flag for accuracy issues | Affects reliability of coordinates |
| **Segment Analysis** | Short (<1km), Medium (1-5km), Long (>5km) | Reveals tracking gaps and continuity |
| **Distance Consistency** | Calculated vs. Manual distance | Validates tracking accuracy |

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Special Case Detection**:
   - "No Logs Trip" if logs_count ≤ 1 or total distance ≤ 0
   - "Trip Points Only Exist" if logs_count < 50 with medium/long segments

2. **Logs Factor Calculation**:
   - `logs_factor = min(logs_count / 500.0, 1.0)`

3. **Segment Ratio Analysis**:
   - `ratio = short_dist / (medium_dist + long_dist + 0.01)`
   - Segment factor based on this ratio

4. **Quality Score Calculation**:
   - `quality_score = 0.5 * logs_factor + 0.5 * segment_factor`
   - Apply 20% penalty if GPS accuracy is lacking

5. **Quality Category Assignment**:
   - High Quality: Score ≥ 0.8 with minimal medium/long segments
   - Moderate Quality: Score ≥ 0.8 but significant medium/long segments
   - Low Quality: Score < 0.5
