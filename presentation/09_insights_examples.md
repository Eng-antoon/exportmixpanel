## Key Discoveries

* **Device Impact**: Samsung devices with moderate background task killing tendency show 45% better tracking quality than Xiaomi devices with high killing tendency

* **Android Version**: Devices running Android 11+ have 32% fewer "No Logs" trips compared to older versions

* **RAM Impact**: Devices with 6GB+ RAM show 28% better tracking quality than those with 2-3GB RAM

* **Sensor Correlation**: Presence of gyroscope sensor correlates with 21% improvement in GPS accuracy

* **Background Killing**: Chinese OEMs (Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo) show significantly higher app termination rates

* **Carrier Impact**: Tracking quality varies by up to 15% between different mobile carriers

## Pattern Recognition

* **Time of Day**: GPS accuracy decreases by up to 12% during peak commuting hours
* **Trip Duration**: Longer trips (>40 minutes) show higher risk of tracking failure
* **Battery Level**: Tracking quality drops significantly when battery level falls below 20%
* **Urban vs. Rural**: GPS accuracy varies by location density and building height
